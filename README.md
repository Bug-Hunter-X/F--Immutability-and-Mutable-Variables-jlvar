This example demonstrates a common error in F# related to immutability and mutable variables.  The `result` variable is initially assigned a value, but later attempts to reassign a new value result in a compile-time error. This is because while `x` and `y` are mutable, the type of `result` is inferred as int.  In F#, this type is immutable by default. To correct the issue, either declare `result` explicitly as a mutable variable or re-design the code to avoid reassigning the variable.
